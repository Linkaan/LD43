# Ludum Dare 43 - Sacrifices must be made

## Idea 002 - The Chosen One

## Premise

- You have 3 traits that determine how powerful you are (strength, defense and speed (movement and attack???))
- You fight enemies in waves, these could also have traits which you can choose to buf instead of nerf yourself
- After every wave, you have to sacrifice one point in one of the traits you have

## Setting

- Based on the [Sacrificial victims of Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrificial_victims_of_Minotaur) in a labyrint
- You play as the hero Theseus (or a deriviate of that name)
