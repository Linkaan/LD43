# Ludum Dare 43 - Sacrifices must be made

## Idea 001 - Energy

## Premise

- A game about balancing 4 energy levels (purple, green, blue and red)
- You can only block 2 sources of energy drains at a time
- If one source of energy runs out, it will drain from the others until it's full
- But if this source of energy is unable to replenish you lose the game
